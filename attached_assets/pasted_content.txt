Step 1: Define the website structure
Include the following pages: Home, Projects, About, Contact.

On the "Projects" page, list each coding project as an interactive card or section.

Each card must include:

Project title

Short description

Tags (e.g., React, Python, WebSockets)

A Rive animation embedded and interactive on hover/click

A "View Project" button linking to GitHub or live demo

Step 2: Implement Rive animations
Each project should use a unique .riv file created in Rive.

Load Rive animations via the Rive JavaScript Runtime.

Trigger animations on:

Mouse hover (for playful interaction)

Click event (for full animation sequence or transition)

Ensure fallback for devices without WebGL.

Step 3: Choose the right tech stack
Use a modern front-end framework (e.g., React with Vite or Next.js for routing and SSR).

TailwindCSS or Styled Components for styling.

Use TypeScript for strict typing and scalable code.

Consider using Framer Motion or GSAP for non-Rive UI transitions.

Host via Vercel or Netlify for fast global delivery.

Step 4: Ensure responsive design
Make sure the site looks excellent on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Responsive behavior should apply to both layout and Rive canvas scaling.

Step 5: Optimize performance
Lazy load all Rive animations to reduce initial load time.

Compress Rive files where applicable.

Defer loading of third-party libraries not needed for first paint.

Step 6: Add accessibility features
Ensure keyboard navigation across all interactive elements.

Use ARIA roles where appropriate for buttons, sections, and modals.

Add descriptive alt text or hidden labels for Rive elements.

Step 7: Bonus interactive features (if time permits)
Add a light/dark mode toggle.

Include a Rive-based loading animation on page transitions.

Use local storage or cookies to remember user preferences.

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.
