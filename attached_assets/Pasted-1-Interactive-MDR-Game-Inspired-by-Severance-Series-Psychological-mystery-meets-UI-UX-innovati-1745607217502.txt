1. Interactive MDR Game – Inspired by Severance Series
🧠 Psychological mystery meets UI/UX innovation

🔧 Tools:
Rive (for animations & transitions)

React + Tailwind (for frontend logic)

Framer Motion (for smooth UI interactions)

Optional: Firebase (for saving player progress)

📌 Key Features:
Simulated MDR terminal environment

Number sorting puzzle mechanic based on “scary” numbers

Eerie soundtrack + distorted visuals as stress builds

Personal progress tracking (with “Innie” vs “Outie” perspective switch)

✅ Steps:
Design UI inspired by Lumon’s MDR terminal — use Rive for transitions.

Create a number-sorting puzzle with uncertainty mechanics (e.g., strange feedback, shifting rules).

Add “Employee Records” that unlock as you progress, revealing story bits.

Implement Framer Motion animations for scene transitions (doors opening, files zooming in, etc).

Create audio-reactive elements for tension (e.g., HR warnings, eerie static).

Optional: Add AI-generated logs (using GPT API or static prompt generations) for immersion.

2. AI Companion Bot for Industrial Maintenance
🤖 Industrial AI meets real-time interaction

🔧 Tools:
ROS2 + Gazebo / Webots

OpenAI Whisper (voice) + GPT (NLP logic)

Unity (for optional AR interface)

📌 Key Features:
Conversational agent embedded in a factory simulation

Voice-controlled inspections & part identification

On-screen augmented visualization of diagnostics

Chatbot learns from maintenance logs over time

✅ Steps:
Simulate a robotic inspection scenario in Gazebo or Webots.

Integrate a voice input system (Whisper or Web Speech API).

Use GPT to process maintenance requests and return responses.

Create a UI (optional AR with Unity/WebAR) to overlay diagnostics on machines.

Add a learning mechanism that improves responses based on past logs.

3. AI-Generated Design Release Workflow Tool
🛠️ Merge release engineering, AI, and UX in one sleek interactive app

🔧 Tools:
Python backend + Streamlit / Next.js frontend

LangChain / GPT for design documentation generation

Figma / Rive for UI mockups

📌 Key Features:
Upload CAD or specs → generate release doc with part specs, tolerances, test cases

Interactive interface for engineers to tweak AI-suggested content

Real-time collaboration with version control simulation

Integration with Jira or GitHub issues (mocked or real)

✅ Steps:
Build a UI that accepts CAD metadata or CSV design inputs.

Use GPT or LangChain to process and generate structured release documentation.

Allow users to review/edit suggestions interactively.

Simulate approval workflows (engineer > lead > QA).

Optional: Add a timeline of iterations for version tracking.
