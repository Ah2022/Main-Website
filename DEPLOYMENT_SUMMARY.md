## Why Vercel Instead of Netlify

Vercel was chosen over Netlify for the following reasons:

1. **Better Support for Full-Stack Applications**: Vercel has excellent support for applications with both frontend and backend components, which this project has.

2. **Serverless Functions**: Vercel's serverless functions work well with Express.js applications, making it easier to deploy the backend.

3. **Seamless React Integration**: Vercel provides optimized deployment for React applications.

4. **Simple Configuration**: Vercel's configuration is straightforward and requires minimal changes to the existing codebase.

5. **Performance**: Vercel offers excellent performance with its global CDN and edge network.

## Deployment Recommendations

1. **GitHub Integration**: Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel for automatic deployments on code changes.

2. **Environment Variables**: Set up any necessary environment variables in the Vercel dashboard.

3. **Custom Domain**: Configure a custom domain in the Vercel dashboard if needed.

4. **Monitoring**: Use Vercel's built-in analytics and monitoring tools to track performance and errors.

5. **Preview Deployments**: Take advantage of Vercel's preview deployments for pull requests to test changes before merging.

## Next Steps

1. Push the updated code to a GitHub repository.
2. Create a Vercel account if you don't have one.
3. Import the GitHub repository into Vercel.
4. Deploy the application.
5. Configure any necessary environment variables.
6. Set up a custom domain if needed.
